## setting up aws credentials
go to IAM and in users -> my user -> security credentials
scroll down and create an acces key for 'local code'
copy and paste the key and secret key into your .env file like so:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 111111111
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 222222222222
in ~ on your terminal run ls -a
find or create .aws folder
create a .config file and a .credentials file
set config to :
[profile default]
region=us-east-2
[profile riddle]
region = us-east-2

set credentials to:
[default]
aws_access_key_id = FOO
aws_secret_access_key = BAR
[riddle]
aws_access_key_id = 111111111111111
aws_secret_access_key = 22222222222

run in backend folder in project: 
export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=riddle

to set the default for the project to be riddle for deployments
this name 'riddle' coming from here is what we have added to the serverless.yml undder profile so the serverless knows what aws account to deploy to
